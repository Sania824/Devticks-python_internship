Daily Progress Report - 3rd July 2025

Today's progress includes completed with Beginner level concepts
To revise those I made 3 mini projects:
1. Leap year Calculater
2. Student Report Card Generator
3. Rock, Paper, Scissor game

These projects used concepts like lists, loops(for, while), conditions (if-else), 
variables, import modules (random for computer to choose randomly between rock, paper and scissor), 
functions, taking user inputs, experimenting with return types, boolean operators, and
using built-in functions like len(), sum()
